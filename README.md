A curated, vendor-aware DNS filtering list for AdGuard Home, AdGuard DNS, and uBlock-compatible engines.

This list focuses on blocking advertising, tracking, and sponsored content infrastructure while explicitly allowing ISP and platform backends required for services such as Ziggo / UPC / Horizon TV.

✨ Design Goals

Readable & maintainable

Vendor-grouped (Amazon, Meta, TikTok, Google, Microsoft, etc.)

DNS-safe (no cosmetic rules unless explicitly marked)

ISP-aware (Ziggo / UPC suffixes handled correctly)

Minimal overblocking

Works alongside AdGuard default filters (no duplication wars)

🔧 Supported Engines

✅ AdGuard Home

✅ AdGuard DNS

✅ uBlock Origin (network rules only)

❌ Not intended as a cosmetic-only filter

🚫 What This List Does NOT Do

❌ Cosmetic hiding (Amazon tiles, Reddit promoted posts)

❌ UI element removal

❌ Replacement for AdGuard default DNS filters

❌ IP-based blocking

Note: Cosmetic issues (e.g. Instagram GIFs, Reddit ads) should be handled by uBlock Origin cosmetic rules, not DNS.
